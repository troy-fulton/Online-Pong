How this will work:

We will use the Arduino as the web SERVER:
    1. Connect the Arduino to the Ethernet and run the web server program.
    2. Open the Serial Comm port and grab the IP address of the server.
    
We will run python on CLIENTS to play the game:
    1. Enter the IP address of the server in the python script wherever it goes.
    2. Run the Python script to play the game.
